screen.html uses data from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density 
to simulate mobile device screens.  

For each screen, it creates an iframe with the specified width and
height and then uses -moz-transform (it is Firefox-specific, for now)
to scale that iframe to simulate the pixel density of the mobile
screen.

There is an input field for entring the pixel density of the screen
you're running on. It defaults to 113 dpi, which is the density of
the 13" MacBook Pro.

There is also an input field for specifying what URL to display on the
simulated screens.  It defaults to testpattern.html which is an
attempt at a flexible layout based on media queries and the CSS rem
unit.
